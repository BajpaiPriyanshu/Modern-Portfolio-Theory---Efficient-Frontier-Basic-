# Modern Portfolio Theory with Efficient Frontier Simulation

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** to optimize stock portfolios.  
It focuses on calculating expected returns, volatility, Sharpe ratios, and constructing the **Efficient Frontier** for visualizing portfolio performance.

## 🚀 Features
- Synthetic stock data generation with realistic return distributions.  
- Annualized return and covariance matrix computation.  
- Portfolio optimization for:
  - Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio  
  - Minimum Variance Portfolio  
- Efficient Frontier construction and visualization.  
- Risk-return analysis with portfolio comparison.
